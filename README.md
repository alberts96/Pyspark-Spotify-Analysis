Te main one, *"track.csv"* the most important and largest, contains music tracks informations from a period of 100 years. The other one instead, *"artist.csv"*,contains a row for each artist. Both the file are comprressed in *data.rar*. Basing on the suggestion of the dataset's author, we identified three main analysis to apply on the data : 
- **Clustering**: on the songs, to identify a limited number of genres 
- **Classification/Regression**: to understand which are the most important features in estimating the popularity of a song
